# Ultimate-TTT
This is a console based JAVA game, the rules and concept can be found in the README file.

There are two classes that allow a selection of players. You may chose computer v.s computer, computer v.s player, or player v.s player.

The starting player will select a board (0 to 8) and then a box to play in (0 to 8). After the selection of the box, that players symbol is placed in the spot.
Then the next player is forced to play on the board that coorelates to the box selected by the first player. Once a winner is reached on a board, that board can still be played on but a new winner can not be reached. Once each little board is filled, the program will calculate a winner based on wether or not a player won three boards in a row.
